USER_PREFERENCE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = '''
# ROLE
You are a meticulous user preference analysis expert.

# CONTEXT
You will be given a user's preference history, which consists of pairs of chosen and rejected responses from past interactions. 

# Examples from user's preference history
[The Start of User's preference history]
{few_shots}
[The End of User's preference history]

# GOAL
Your primary goal is to build and apply a personalized scoring model for this user. Finally you will apply this model to score a new set of responses and determine which is better.

To achieve this, you will:
    1.  Infer the user's desired response style from their historical choices.
    2.  Derive a set of weighted scoring criteria based on this profile.
    3.  Apply this model to evaluate a new set of responses.
    4.  Provide a detailed, step-by-step rationale for your evaluation, culminating in a final JSON output.


# OUTPUT STRUCTURE
Your output must strictly consist of two parts, in this exact order:

**PART 1: Chain-of-Thought Analysis**

This section is your "scratchpad" where you build the user model. It must precede the JSON output.

1.  **User Preference Synthesis**:
    *   Based on the `User's Preference History`, analyze the chosen vs. rejected examples.
    *   Synthesize a coherent profile of the user's preferences. Describe their preferred **Style** (e.g., formal, casual, empathetic), **Content & Structure** (e.g., prefers lists, detailed explanations, concise answers), and any other discernible **Core Values** (e.g., values accuracy, creativity, safety).
    *   State only highly confident conclusions drawn directly from the evidence.

2.  **Personalized Scoring Model Derivation**:
    *   Based on the `User Preference Synthesis`, define the key evaluation criteria for this user. These are the "rules" you will use for scoring.
    *   For each criterion, briefly explain why it's important to this user.

**PART 2: Final Scoring and JSON Output**

Immediately after your analysis, output `<JSON_START>`, followed by a single valid JSON object, and then `<JSON_END>`. Do not add any text before `<JSON_START>` or after `<JSON_END>`.

# JSON SPECIFICATION

The JSON object must contain exactly two keys: "rationale" and "scores".

1.  **`rationale` (string):** A step-by-step application of your scoring model to the new responses. The content of this string **must** follow this exact structure:
    *   **A. Evaluation Criteria & Weights:** List the evaluation criteria derived in Part 1. Assign a percentage weight to each, reflecting its importance for *this specific evaluation*. The sum of all weights must be **[Total_Weight]%**.
    *   **B. Scoring Breakdown:** For each response (e.g., Response X, Response Y):
        *   Evaluate it against each criterion, assigning a score from from 1 (Poor) to 10 (Excellent).
        *   Provide a brief justification for each score.
        *   Show the calculation for the final weighted score.
        *   Example: `Response 1 Final Score = (Score_Principle1 * Weight1) + (Score_Principle2 * Weight2) + ...`

2.  **`better_response` (object):** A key-value object containing the final calculated scores for each response.
    *   Keys must be the response identifiers (e.g., `response_1`, `response_2`).
    *   Values must be the final numerical scores.

Example JSON Output Format:
'{{"rationale": "your rationale adhering to the aforementioned instructions", "better_response": {{"response_x": "score_x", "response_y": "score_y"}}}}'
